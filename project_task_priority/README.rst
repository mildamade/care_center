=======================
Project Task Priorities
=======================

This module synchronizes the Task priority field with the priority field in Issues.

In case this module is uninstalled, all the tasks that were previously set at `High` will be reverted to `Normal` and
tasks above `High` priority will be reverted to `High` priority.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Open a task or create a new one
#. On the priority widget, five stars are displayed (instead of one)
